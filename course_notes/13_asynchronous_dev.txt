Chapter 13: Asynchronous Python Development

#Processes and Threads

-Processor(CPU's) have cores - units that perform mathematical operation

-Threads - Processes that we want to do that do not have the resources available (waiting)
-A line of code execution
-One thread can run in one core

Threads run within a core

-Process - has at least one thread + some resources from the OS + core
This manages all the things needed for a thread to run

Time Slicing
-moving between waiting threads and running threads

PYTHON GIL
-Global Interpreter Lock
Thread must aquire the GIL to run, then can release to another thread
Each process creates its own GIL i.e pycharm + jupyterlab
-Can only run one python script at a time as requires same resource

Why threads?
Reduces waiting time

- Complex math operation
- Short operation (input) - can take a long time if user types slowly
-release GIL while waiting for user to type
