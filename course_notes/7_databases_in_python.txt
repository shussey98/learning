Chapter 7: Databases
-A place where we can store data
-Organised into tables with an id
-SQLite can run in memory or as a single file (good for single user)
-SQL (structured query language)
-Only one person can write to the file at a time
-hhtp://sqlitebrowser.org

-.py :
import sqlite3
connection = sqlite3.connect('data.db')
connection.close()

CURSOR
- all operations in SQLite made by cursors
-cursor points to a place in database starting at the top
-reading row moves down one

COMMIT()
-save result of the query to disk
-can commit multiple things at once

cursor = connection.cursor()
cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books(name text primary key, author text, read integer)'
connection.commit()
connection.close()

INSERT INTO books VALUES(?, ?,0)
SELECT * ,id,name FROM people
books = cursor.fetchall()

#filtering else whole column will be set/deleted
UPDATE books SET name='Joseph' WHERE id=1
DELETE FROM people WHERE id=1
#conditional
SELECT * FROM id WHERE amount > 150 OR type = 'online' != = AND
SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1
